# 2D-Image-to-3D-model
This Python application detects geometric shapes in images using OpenCV and generates 3D models. It processes images to identify shapes like triangles, squares, and circles. The Tkinter GUI allows users to load images, view detected shapes, and save 3D models in STL format, supporting cubes, pyramids, and cones with numpy-stl library.
